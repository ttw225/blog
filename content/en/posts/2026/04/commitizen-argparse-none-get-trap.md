> The fix rewrites how `message_length_limit` is assigned and handles `None` explicitly.

If `message_length_limit` is set in `pyproject.toml`, it should apply to `cz commit` / `cz check`. In practice, the configured value is ignored.

Below I use `commit` as the main example; `check` has the same issue.

## Misusing `get()`

Key snippet from the original implementation:

```python {title="commitizen/commands/commit.py"}
self.max_msg_length = arguments.get(
    "message_length_limit", config.settings.get("message_length_limit", 0)
```

At first glance this suggests `CLI > config > 0`, but that is not what happens.

### Trap 1: `add_argument` defaults to `None`, and the key is always there

Without an explicit `default`, `argparse` still puts the argument on the namespace; its value is just `None`.

So when the user does not pass `-l`, `arguments["message_length_limit"]` is `None`, not “missing.”

That makes `arguments.get("message_length_limit", ...)` return `None` immediately, so the fallback never runs.

In that situation the code is effectively:

```python
self.max_msg_length = arguments.get("message_length_limit")
```

### Trap 2: `config.settings["message_length_limit"]` always exists

`config.settings` is seeded from `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`, then overlaid with user config.

In `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`, `message_length_limit` defaults to `0`:

```python {title="commitizen/defaults.py"}
"message_length_limit": 0,  # 0 for no limit
```

So for `config.settings.get("message_length_limit", 0)`, the `0` fallback is almost never reached.

## Back to the source code

### How `commit` defines the CLI argument

```python {title="commitizen/cli.py"}
...
{
    "name": ["-l", "--message-length-limit"],
    "type": int,
    "help": "Set the length limit of the commit message; 0 for no limit.",
},
...
```

With no `default`, omitting `-l/--message-length-limit` yields `None`.

### The subject-length check

```python {title="commitizen/commands/commit.py"}
def _validate_subject_length(self, message: str) -> None:
    message_length_limit = self.arguments.get(
        "message_length_limit", self.config.settings.get("message_length_limit", 0)
    )
    # By the contract, message_length_limit is set to 0 for no limit
    if message_length_limit is None or message_length_limit <= 0:
        return
```

| CLI value provided | Config value provided | What you actually get | Matches intent |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| Yes | No | CLI value | ✅ |
| No | No | `None`, treated as no limit | ✅ (accidentally OK) |
| No | Yes | Still `None`, config skipped | ❌ |
| Yes | Yes | CLI value | ✅ |

The flaw is easy to miss because the next guard does this:

```python
if message_length_limit is None or message_length_limit <= 0:
    return
```

So wrong precedence can still look fine in many cases.

### How to fix it

Split `get()` from the fallback and branch on `None` explicitly:

```python
message_length_limit: int | None = arguments.get("message_length_limit")
self.message_length_limit: int = (
    message_length_limit
    if message_length_limit is not None
    else config.settings["message_length_limit"]
)
```

Takeaways:

1. Read `arguments["message_length_limit"]`, then test for `None`.
2. Use `is not None`; a bare `if message_length_limit` would wrongly treat `0` as unset.
3. Fall back to `config.settings["message_length_limit"]` only when the CLI did not supply a value.
4. That restores the intended order: `CLI > config > default(0)`.

## Why tests did not catch it

### How tests are written

A typical `commit` test looks like:

```python {title="tests/commands/test_commit_command.py"}
commands.Commit(config, {"message_length_limit": message_length})()
```

The first argument, `config`, is fine. The blind spot is the second (mock CLI args):

- tests often pass a dict with an explicit value,
- but omit the realistic case where the user did not pass the flag and the value is `None`.

In short, tests did not model `{"message_length_limit": None}`.

### What to add in tests

Covering the `None` case makes the “config ignored” bug reproducible and prevents regressions.

## Conclusion

This kind of bug is common but subtle: `argparse` means “key present, value `None`,” which clashes with `dict.get()` fallback semantics. Mix in how `0` and `None` behave in conditionals, and you get easy-to-miss logic holes.
